**Literature Review:**

1\. Li et al. (2019) - "Face recognition with augmented reality using 3D face models" 

This study proposed an AR face recognition system that utilized 3D face models for accurate identification. The authors presented a comprehensive framework incorporating face detection, alignment, feature extraction, and classification using deep learning techniques. The proposed approach outperformed traditional 2D face recognition methods.This framework was to detect faces in the input images or video frames. This is a crucial step as it identifies the regions of interest within the scene.The detected faces were aligned to a standard position and pose. By aligning the faces, the system reduces the impact of pose variations, enabling better feature extraction.The aligned faces were then used to extract facial features, which encode distinctive characteristics of each individual. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were employed for effective feature extraction.After extracting the features, the authors constructed 3D face models using the available data. These 3D models captured the  spatial  information  of  the  face,  adding  an  additional  dimension  to  the  recognition process.Finally, the 3D face models were used for face recognition through classification algorithms. The authors utilized deep learning methods, such as softmax regression, to classify the extracted features and determine the identity of the individual.

By accurately detecting these landmarks, the framework achieved better alignment of faces in the AR environment. In addition to facial landmarks detection, the study also incorporated head pose estimation. This process involved estimating the orientation of the face in the AR scene, which is crucial for accurately recognizing and tracking the face. The framework included techniques for aligning the detected faces and adjusting their position and orientation in the AR environment. This alignment process aims to mitigate the impact of variations in lighting and occlusions, leading to improved face recognition accuracy. 

5\.Adaptive Augmented  Reality  User  Interfaces  Using  Face Recognition for Smart  Home Control 

A preliminary study was conducted with 5 participants to evaluate the robustness of the face recognition authentication process.Participants were inserted in the system as new users, to create the training model. Eachuser was asked to log using face recognition ten times. Results show that 74% of thetimes, participants were successfully found and the remaining 26% of the times theapplication detected the wrong participant.The developed application opens up new possibilities for the way users interact andcontrol the Smart Home concept moving forward, by pointing  at  specific  localizationsand  appliances,  while  being  confronted  with  adaptive interfaces based on the recogni-tion of the user face.

7\. Park, J., & Kim, H. (2016). Augmented reality-based face recognition for mobile devices. 

This paper proposes an approach for implementing marker-based augmented reality (AR) on smartphone. Specifically, to resolve the obtrusiveness of visual markers, use of infrared (IR) markers that are not visible to the human eye is studied. The main idea is to use an additional external camera with IR functionality to track IR markers that are not detectable in smartphone camera. Additionally is to put a visual fiducial object at the place where the fields of view of the external camera and the smartphone camera are overlapping, which enables the external camera to track the geometric transform between the fiducial object and the IR markers. As a result, since the fiducial object is trackable with the smartphone camera, the smartphone camera pose relative to the IR markers can be computed by using the transform. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a proof-of-concept system is implemented where a visual marker is used as fiducial object for the convenience of implementation. The system accuracy mainly depends on the transform accuracy. Thus, to improve the transform accuracy, two constraints are defined and evaluated: one is that both markers lie on the same plane and the other is that the 3D marker data is available. Through experiments, with the constraints, it is verified that virtual contents can be stably augmented on IR markers in smartphone camera images.

It also represented the current state of deep learning-based object detection in AR. 

9\. 3D Face Recognition 

This paper provides a 3D face recognition technology has been applied in many fields, such as access control and automatic driving. The iPhone X uses Face ID, technology that unlocks the phone by using infrared and visible light scans to uniquely identify your face. It works in a variety of conditions and is extremely secure. In the world of autonomous driving, the autopilot needs to manage the hand-over between the automated and the manual modes. To have a smooth hand-over, it is important to make sure that the driver is alert and ready to take control of the car before the autopilot is disengaged. To have a smooth transition between modes of operation,  Omron  introduce  3D  facial  recognition  technology  that  detects  a  drowsy  or distracted driver. Considering the fact that one out of every six car accidents is attributed to a drowsy or distracted driver, the technology can have a huge impact even on the safety of manual driving.

**Inferences from Output:** 

**Accuracy** 

The accuracy of the face recognition system can be inferred by analyzing the recognition rate and false acceptance rate (FAR). A high recognition rate indicates that the system correctly identifies individuals with a high degree of accuracy. A low FAR indicates that the system rarely misidentifies individuals, minimizing the risk of false positives. 

**Robustness** 

The robustness of the face recognition system can be assessed by evaluating its performance under various conditions, such as different lighting conditions, poses, and facial expressions. A robust system should maintain consistent accuracy across a range of real-world scenarios. 

**User Experience** 

The user experience of the AR-based face recognition system can be evaluated based on factors like ease of use, intuitiveness of the interface, and overall satisfaction of the users. A positive user experience enhances the overall adoption and acceptance of the system. 

**Computational Efficiency** 

The computational efficiency of the system can be determined by measuring the processing time required for face detection, feature extraction, and matching. A computationally efficient system ensures smooth and responsive performance, particularly for real-time applications. 

**Benchmarking of Results:** 

Evaluate  the  system  using  standardized  datasets  that  represent  a  diverse  range  of  facial data.Test the system in simulated environments that replicate real-world scenarios, such as different  lighting  conditions  or  crowded  environments.  Deploy  the  system  in  real-world environments and collect performance data under actual usage conditions. 

**Benchmarking Tools and Frameworks** 

OpenFace: A popular open-source library for face detection, feature extraction, and matching. 

Face++: A commercial face recognition API that provides benchmarking tools for accuracy and latency. 

Face Recognition SDK: A commercial face recognition SDK that provides benchmarking tools for a variety of performance metrics. 

MetaFace: An open-source framework for building face recognition applications with built-in benchmarking capabilities. 

**Conclusion:** 

AR-based face recognition systems have the potential to revolutionize various applications, from security and access control to personalized experiences and augmented reality overlays. However,  the  successful  development  and  deployment  of  these  systems  require  careful consideration  of  several  factors,  including  accuracy,  robustness,  user  experience, computational  efficiency,  privacy  considerations,  and  benchmarking.By  addressing  these challenges and continuously innovating, AR-based face recognition systems can unlock new possibilities for enhancing human-computer interaction and enabling a more immersive and personalized digital world.
